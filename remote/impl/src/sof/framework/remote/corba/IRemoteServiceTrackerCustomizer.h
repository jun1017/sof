 * For using this interface it has to be implemented and an instance of the implementing

 * Example:<p>
 * <code>
 * ServiceTracker tracker = new ServiceTracker( bundleContext, "ServiceB", serviceTrackerCustomizer );<br>
 * this->tracker->startTracking();
 * </code><p>
 * Afterwards the service tracker object is started the tracker listens for service object changes
 * (registering, deregistering) and forwards the changes to the service tracker customizer.
